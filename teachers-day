**Cikgu Nora**

Cikgu Nora IS so funny and friendly.
I like her lessons
because when she calls me to answer a question I always know how to.
She cracks many jokes, and pronounces some names wrongly. 
whenever i hear her say shen en or jayleen its so funny.
She adds laughter to her lessons, and often give us breaks.
She is very kind and nice
She is very good
