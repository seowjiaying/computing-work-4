**Cikgu Nora**

Cikgu Nora IS so funny and friendly.
I like her lessons
because when she calls me to answer a question I always know how to.
She adds fun to our lessons and sometimes give us breaks.
She cracks many jokes, and pronounces some names wrongly. 
whenever i hear her say shen en or jayleen its so funny.
She is very kind and nice
She is very good
